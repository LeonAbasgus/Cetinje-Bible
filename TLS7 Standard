📚 What is the TLS7 Standard?

TLS7 stands for Text Layered Structure — 7 Levels. It is a human- and machine-friendly format for presenting complex texts—especially ancient, sacred, or foreign-language works—in a clear, structured, and gradually learnable form.

Each text unit (typically a verse or sentence) is represented across seven analytical layers:

Original Text – fully vocalized with cantillation (where applicable)

Transliteration – according to a recognized phonetic system (e.g., SBL for Hebrew)

Translation – into a target modern language (e.g., English)

Morphological Analysis – word-by-word: lemma, part of speech, grammar, gloss

Syntactic Commentary – an explanation of how the sentence is structured

Thematic/Contextual Notes – optional annotations, background info, or commentary

Rendering Layer – HTML/JS or other formats to make the above interactive and educational

⚙️ Designed for Humans and Machines (H&M-Friendly)
TLS7 is deliberately H&M-friendly: it allows both human learners and machine systems (e.g., NLP models, language parsers, educational AIs) to interact with, process, and learn from complex textual data in a modular, standardized way.

Its structure makes it ideal for:

Human self-education (e.g. schoolchildren, autodidacts, scholars)

Natural Language Processing tasks

Machine-assisted translation and commentary

Scalable content generation and alignment across languages

🔁 A Standard with a Future
TLS7 is designed to evolve. As computational tools advance, additional layers or refinements may be introduced—e.g., semantic disambiguation, dynamic glossing, embedded audio, visual aids, and multilingual cross-alignment.

It can also serve as the foundation for a global semantic infrastructure—much like the Latin script did for phonetic transliteration. The ultimate vision is to provide a unified semantic interface for any complex text, adapted to the cognitive level of the reader, whether human or machine.

In short: TLS7 is not just a format. It is a scalable model for linguistic digestion and educational structuring—designed for the post-AI age of universal, accessible, and meaningful humanities education.
