Syntactic Overview
The sentence is a description of the chaotic state of the earth, characterized by a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) structure. "Hayetah" (was) connects the subject "the earth" to its state of being, followed by two nouns describing the condition—"tohu" and "vohu" (without form and void). Darkness and the abyss are also described with prepositional phrases "al-penei" (upon the face). The verse then shifts to the action of the Spirit of God, who "moves" (merachefet) upon the waters, signifying the divine presence in the chaotic state.
